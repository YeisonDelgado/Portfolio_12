# **App Name**: FractalSphere 3D

## Core Features:

- 3D Fractal Sphere Generation: Generates a 3D fractal sphere using Three.js and WebGL, with lines converging to form a sphere.
- Smooth Animation: Implements smooth, continuous animation at 60 FPS using requestAnimationFrame.
- Interactive Controls: Allows users to rotate the camera around the sphere via mouse drag, zoom in/out with scroll, and control animation via Play/Pause/Reset buttons and speed selector.
- Color Scheme Selection: Provides options to select different color schemes for the sphere, including Rainbow, Plasma, Monochrome, and Sunset.
- Performance Metrics: Displays an FPS counter and information about the number of vertices and lines rendered.
- Screenshots: Option for users to capture screenshots of the animation

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gradient from black to dark gray (#222222 to #444444) to create depth and contrast.
- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#3498db) to draw the eye and define the geometry.
- Accent color: Purple (#9b59b6) as an analogous color to the primary, used for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its readability and modern aesthetic.
- Simple, outlined icons for control buttons to maintain a clean interface.
- Smooth transitions and animations to enhance user experience; subtle pulsing effect synchronized with sphere convergence.
